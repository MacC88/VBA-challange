This is a script that will return the value for each ticker:
  -yearly change
  -percent change
  -total stock volume
  
It then greates a different list for each ticker that has:
  -greatest % increase
  -greatest % decrease
  -greatest total volume

In the wiki page you can see pictures of the data before and after the script was run.
